    Back-End Bound: 91.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 80.7% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

                 | accesses that hit the L3 cache under unloaded scenarios
                 | (possibly L3 latency limited). Avoiding private cache misses
                 | (i.e. L2 misses/L3 hits) will improve the latency, reduce
                 | contention with sibling physical cores and increase
                 | performance. Note the value of this node may overlap with its

         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a

         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
